# Printable cards
These printable cards can help with learning and staying productive and
organized. They're meant to be printed onto thick paper or thin card stock, but
any kind of paper will work.

This is not meant to replace software solutions. Keeping a task backlog on
paper is impractical, but writing down your daily tasks and ideas is helpful.

## Use cases
- Simple task lists
- Reminders
- Interval-based time management
- Zettelkasten notes
- Flash cards for presentations
- Creating a 'commonplace book'
- Brainstorming

## Tools needed
- A printer
- Paper
- A paper cutter (preferably, but scissors or a knife will do)
- A knife and cutting mat for tab cards
- A corner cutter (optional, if you prefer rounded corners)

## Why use paper?
Paper forces you to be mindful of what you write down because it takes time and
effort. The physical act of writing helps with dedicating to tasks. It helps
with memorization. It allows you to go fully offline and disconnect and focus
on what needs to be done. Physically checking boxes feels rewarding. Pen and
paper will always work, even in a power outage. It is endlessly customisable.
It is privacy friendly because it can be completely destroyed.

And most of all, putting pen to paper causes a special feeling that no software
can achieve.

## What about the environment?
A downside of using paper is that it isn't very environmentally friendly (but
neither is the electricity usage of using software or the production of
hardware). Please try to be responsible by minimizing waste and using fairly
sourced, recycled paper.

## Why use cards instead of sticky notes/full-size paper/a journal?
Because they can be...
- stacked and shuffled
- individually moved, rearranged or destroyed
- used for spaced repetition learning
- clipped onto things
- used to create a Zettelkasten
- limitlessly arranged on a table
- placed in a box with tab cards to create an overview of projects and ideas

These cards work well when used alongside a journal. Log thoughts, ideas,
events, meeting notes, phone calls, etc. in a journal, and use the cards for
task lists and all other use cases listed above.

## No backups?!
A downside of using paper is that there's no automatic method of backing things
up. Make sure to digitize important information.
